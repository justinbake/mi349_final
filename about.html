<h2>About the site</h2>

<p>Find a streamer is a two-way interactive website designed to connect live streamers and
    consumers. <br> <br>

    Find a streamer works by streamers entering in information about themselves and their channel.
    Then, viewers can search by keywords or categories to find streamers across all different
    platforms. Designed with discovery in mind, find a streamer goes above and beyond in terms of
    preferences and selection. We are dedicated to helping streamers grow and viewers find a
    place where they feel like they belong.</p>


<h3>About the creator</h3>
<p><img src="headshot.png" alt="headshot" width="200" height="200"></p>
<p>My name is Justin Baker and I am a student in MI 349 at MSU. I am 22 years old and I love to play and watch video games. I created this site because it's difficult for small streamers to get noticed. Also, I personally enjoy watching small streamers.  </p>



<p>Hope you like the site!</p>
